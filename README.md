# Predictive Modeling for Hospital Readmission

## Overview
This project focuses on predictive modeling to foresee hospital readmissions of diabetic patients within 30 days post-discharge. By leveraging a dataset spanning a decade (1999-2008) and covering records from 130 US hospitals, the aim is to enhance healthcare management and patient outcomes.

## Project Structure
- `/diabetic_data.csv`: Contains the dataset used in the analysis.
- `/Readmission_Predictions.ipynb`: Includes Jupyter notebook used for exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and modeling.
- `/Final_Report`: Stores the final report and support documentation.

## Installation and Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (version 3.8.10)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

## Data Sources
- The dataset spans a decade (1999-2008) and includes records from 130 US hospitals, focusing on diabetic patients.
