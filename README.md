# Predictive Modeling for Hospital Readmission

## Overview
This project focuses on predictive modeling to foresee hospital readmissions of diabetic patients within 30 days post-discharge. By leveraging a dataset spanning a decade (1999-2008) and covering records from 130 US hospitals, the aim is to enhance healthcare management and patient outcomes.

## Data Sources
- The dataset spans a decade (1999-2008) and includes records from 130 US hospitals, focusing on diabetic patients.
- You can access the dataset via the following link: [Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)

## Project Structure
- `/diabetic_data.csv`: Contains the dataset used in the analysis.
- `/Readmission_Predictions.ipynb`: Includes Jupyter notebook used for exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and modeling.
